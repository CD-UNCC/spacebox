SPACEBOX is an idea to bring certain exciting aspects of space to one central location
Things such as:
-News from space and involving space
-current activities taking place in space
-videos and pictures new from space
-upcoming launches or landings in and out of space
-current astronomical events or statuses[meteor showers, moon phase, conjunctions, etc.]

The idea is to make use of all the exciting APIs involving the cosmos that are available to us. 
If there is not an API where there should be, we make one with kimonolabs.

Current APIs being used are:
http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/People-In-Space/ 
https://api.nasa.gov/index.html [for apod background]
